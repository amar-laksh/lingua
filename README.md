-[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGWpbDI11Ik)

# Principles

- Start with learning about the linguistic nature of the language first
- Focus on the language material that is important to you (literature and tech stuff)
- Write the language by hand and speak while writing.
- Decide on the dialect you wanna focus on. (e.g. select all media according to that)

# Actions

- Listen a lot (simple radio shows, tv cartoons)
- Look at the body language and facial expression (youtube videos)
- Start mixing words you learn everytime (e.g. me want cat)
- Use the language as the tool against itself (e.g. I don't understand this, what is this?)
- Try writing what you see around you in that language. (starting from just words to prose)
