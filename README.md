# Good Intros to Lingustics

-[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGWpbDI11Ik)
- Learn the IPA

-Learn IPA to easily convert to target language to grasp accent.
# Reverse Engineering for target language
- Choose target language by:
    - Lowest Orthographic depth (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.13321.pdf)
- Identify the type of language:
    - polysynthetic vs isolating
    - Check if the language follows Generative Grammar

- Next, have a look at the target language phonology: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{lang}_phonology
- Next, Learn about Phonemes and Allophones charts for target language
- Next, Try to learn the morphemes of the target language:
    - Root Words
    - Affixes (Prefixes, Suffixes, Infixes)
    - Inflection
    - Derivational
- Next, Try to understand the Allomorphy of the morphemes.
- Next, Learn mappings to signified and signifier:
    - Identify types of signs:
        - Icon
        - Index
        - Symbol
    - Fun thing to do: look at morphemes synchronically and diachronically
- Next, Try to grasp how the sentences are structured through constituents.
- Next, Observe Syntax Trees to find more about semantics (remember the flat trees)
- Next, Observer all the different types of NPs (R-expressions, Pronouns, Anaphors)
- Next, understand D structure changes in Trees in the target language.
- Next, Observer the binding theory rules to understand limits in the target language
    - Anaphors must be bound from within the smallest clause that contains it.
    - A pronoun must be unbound within the smallest class that contains it.
    - R-expressions must not be bound.
- Next, observe the semantic roles and syntactic functions in the grammar

# Principles

- Start with learning about the linguistic nature of the language first
- Focus on the language material that is important to you (literature and tech stuff)
- Write the language by hand and speak while writing.
- Decide on the dialect you wanna focus on. (e.g. select all media according to that)

# Actions

- Listen a lot (simple radio shows, tv cartoons)
- Look at the body language and facial expression (youtube videos)
- Start mixing words you learn everytime (e.g. me want cat)
- Use the language as the tool against itself (e.g. I don't understand this, what is this?)
- Try writing what you see around you in that language. (starting from just words to prose)
